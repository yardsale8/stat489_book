   Portions of this textbook were adapted from the following (excellent) 
   `introductory textbook <https://interactivepython.org/runestone/static/thinkcspy/index.html#>`_.  
   If you are interested in using an open-source, online, interactive textbook 
   in an introductory programming course, this book is highly recommend by the 
   primary author (Todd Iverson).
