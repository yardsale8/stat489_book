Functional List Processing
::::::::::::::::::::::::::

In this chapter, we will take a look at the functional approach to processing
sequences of data.  We start by definition three general types of sequence
processing tasks. Then we look at the Python function in more depth, followed by
defining data structures and functions recursively.  Next, tail recursion is
used to improve some recursive tasks using an accumulator.  Finally, we compare
solutions based on list comprehensions to those that use recursion.
