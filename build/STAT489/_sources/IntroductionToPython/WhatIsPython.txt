What is Python?
===============

The Python Programming Language
-------------------------------

The programming language you will be learning is Python. Python is an example
of a **high-level language**; other high-level languages you might have heard
of are C++, PHP, and Java.

.. As you might infer from the name high-level language, there are also
.. **low-level languages**, sometimes referred to as machine languages or assembly
.. languages. Machine language is the encoding of instructions in binary so that they can be directly executed by the computer.  Assembly language uses a slightly easier format to refer to the low level instructions.
.. Loosely speaking, computers can only execute programs written in
.. low-level languages.  To be exact, computers can actually only execute programs written in machine language. Thus, programs written in a high-level language (and even those in assembly language) have to be
.. processed before they can run. This extra processing takes some time, which is
.. a small disadvantage of high-level languages.
.. However, the advantages to high-level languages are enormous.
.. 
.. First, it 
It
is much easier to program in a
high-level language. Programs written in a high-level language take less time
to write, they are shorter and easier to read, and they are more likely to be
correct. Second, high-level languages are **portable**, meaning that they can
run on different kinds of computers with few or no modifications. Low-level
programs can run on only one kind of computer and have to be rewritten to run
on another.

Due to these advantages, almost all programs are written in high-level
languages. Low-level languages are used only for a few specialized
applications.

Two kinds of programs process high-level languages into low-level languages:
**interpreters** and **compilers**. An interpreter reads a high-level program
and executes it, meaning that it does what the program says. It processes the
program a little at a time, alternately reading lines and performing
computations.

A compiler reads the program and translates it completely before the program
starts running. In this case, the high-level program is called the **source
code**, and the translated program is called the **object code** or the
**executable**. Once a program is compiled, you can execute it repeatedly
without further translation.

.. image:: Figures/compile.png
   :alt: Compile illustration

Many modern languages use both processes. They are first compiled into a lower
level language, called **byte code**, and then interpreted by a program called
a **virtual machine**. Python uses both processes, but because of the way
programmers interact with it, it is usually considered an interpreted language.

There are three ways to use the Python interpreter: *shell mode* *program
mode*.  We will also explore a hybrid of the shell mode by using the *Jupyter
notebook.* In shell mode, you type Python expressions into the **Python shell**,
and the interpreter immediately shows the result.  The example below shows the Python shell at work.

::

    $ python3
    Python 3.2 (r32:88445, Mar 25 2011, 19:28:28)
    [GCC 4.5.2] on linux2
    Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.
    >>> 2 + 3
    5
    >>>

The ``>>>`` is called the **Python prompt**. The interpreter uses the prompt to
indicate that it is ready for instructions. We typed ``2 + 3``.  The interpreter
evaluated our expression and replied ``5``. On the next line it gave a new
prompt indicating that it is ready for more input.

Working directly in the interpreter is convenient for testing short bits of
code because you get immediate feedback. Think of it as scratch paper used to
help you work out problems.

Alternatively, you can write an entire program by placing lines of Python
instructions in a file and then use the interpreter to execute the contents of
the file as a whole. Such a file is often referred to as **source code**.  For
example, we used a text editor to create a source code file named
``firstprogram.py`` with the following contents:

.. sourcecode:: python

    print("My first program adds two numbers, 2 and 3:")
    print(2 + 3)

By convention, files that contain Python programs have names that end with
``.py`` .  Following this convention will help your operating system and other
programs identify a file as containing python code.

::

    $ python firstprogram.py
    My first program adds two numbers, 2 and 3:
    5

These examples show Python being run from a Unix command line. In other
development environments, the details of executing programs may differ. Also,
most programs are more interesting than this one.

When working with data, it is natural to interact with the data *interactively*.
We will be using python packages `Jupyter` and `Ipython` for this purpose.
Below you see the output of evaluating this program in the interactive
interpreter.  


.. ipython:: python

    "My first program adds two numbers, 2 and 3:"
    2 + 3

Note that we don't need the print statements when working
interactively, and in fact, print statements can be a common source of errors
for programmers that are new to python.


.. caution::

    You should try to limit the use of print statements in your code.  In the
    interactive code blocks in the book, we are forced to use `print` statements,
    but you should should try to limit your use of the `print` function.
    
.. admonition:: When to use `print` 

    Use `print` ...

    1. as a temparary debugging toy.  In this case, the print calls should be removed after the bugs are fixed.
    2. when writing python shell scripts that interact with other programs (We will show examples of this later in the book.
    3. To log information to a file.  This is a useful development tool, but **will not** play a role in this book.

A Typical First Program
-----------------------

Traditionally, the first program written in a new language is called *Hello,
World!* because all it does is display the words, Hello, World!  In Python, the source code
looks like this.

.. sourcecode:: python

    print("Hello, World!")

This is an example of using the **print function**, which doesn't actually
print anything on paper. It displays a value on the screen. In this case, the result is the phrase:

::

    Hello, World!

Here is the example in activecode.  Give it a try!

.. activecode:: ch01_2

    print("Hello, World!")

The quotation marks in the program mark the beginning and end of the value.
They don't appear in the result.

Some people judge the quality of a programming language by the simplicity of
the Hello, World! program. By this standard, Python does about as well as
possible.

In the earlier section, we gave a warning about using the print statement.  The
reason for this warning with the nature of `print`, which outputs text to
the computer display.  This output is then outside the scope of our program and
*cannot* be used later in the program.  A common "rookee mistake" is to mistake
the output of print with a python value that can be used later in our program.
To illustrate, consider the following `IPython` output.

.. ipython:: python

    print("Hello, World!")
    2+3

Notice the lack of `Out[3]` on the evaluation of the `print` call.  This is an
indication that this function is not returning a value that we can later use in
our program.  This is an example of a *side-effect*, which will be defined and
discussed at length in a later chapter.

**Check your understanding**

.. mchoice:: question1_11_1
   :answer_a: sends information to the printer to be printed on paper.
   :answer_b: displays a value on the screen.
   :answer_c: tells the computer to put the information in print, rather than cursive, format.
   :answer_d: tells the computer to speak the information.
   :correct: b
   :feedback_a: Within the Python programming language, the print function has nothing to do with the printer.
   :feedback_b: Yes, the print function is used to display the value of the thing being printed.
   :feedback_c: The format of the information is called its font and has nothing to do with the print function.
   :feedback_d: That would be a different function.

   The print function:


Comments
--------

As programs get bigger and more complicated, they get more difficult to read.
Formal languages are dense, and it is often difficult to look at a piece of
code and figure out what it is doing, or why.
For this reason, it is a good idea to add notes to your programs to explain in
natural language what the program is doing.  These notes are called comments.

A **comment** in a computer program is text that is intended only for the human
reader - it is completely ignored by the interpreter.
In Python, the `#` token starts a comment.  The rest of the line is ignored.
Here is a new version of *Hello, World!*.

.. activecode:: ch01_3

    #---------------------------------------------------
    # This demo program shows off how elegant Python is!
    # Written by Joe Soap, December 2010.
    # Anyone may freely copy or modify this program.
    #---------------------------------------------------

    print("Hello, World!")     # Isn't this easy!

Notice that when you run this program, it still only prints the phrase Hello, World!  None of the comments appear.
You'll also notice that we've left a blank line in the program.  Blank lines
are also ignored by the interpreter, but comments and blank lines can make your
programs much easier for humans to parse.  Use them liberally!

**Check your understanding**

.. mchoice:: question1_12_1
   :answer_a: To tell the computer what you mean in your program.
   :answer_b: For the people who are reading your code to know, in natural language, what the program is doing.
   :answer_c: Nothing, they are extraneous information that is not needed.
   :answer_d: Nothing in a short program.  They are only needed for really large programs.
   :correct: b
   :feedback_a: Comments are ignored by the computer.
   :feedback_b: The computer ignores comments.  It's for the humans that will "consume" your program.
   :feedback_c: Comments can provide much needed information for anyone reading the program.
   :feedback_d: Even small programs benefit from comments.

   What are comments for?
